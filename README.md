# reimagined-design-patterns

Give a summary description of Four design patterns that you choose from the following design patterns: **Adapter,  Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, Interpreter, State, Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Proxy**. In your summaries say:

- what kind of problem(s) you can solve with that pattern and when you use it, maybe with a short example
- how the pattern works, what the basic idea of the pattern is
- what the main advantage and what the the main disadvantage is of using this pattern
- Write a short summary for each of the four patterns, about half a page for each pattern (rather less than more). 

> Do not add diagrams, and do not try to give a complete description of the patterns as found in the books. Rather think of how you would explain the essential ideas of these patterns in a few sentences to a colleague while drinking coffee.

1. Observer Pattern

> This is one of the behavioral pattern. This pattern has a publisher subscriber model.Suppose we wish to subscibe a magazine/newspaper 
  from a particular publisher. So we can call the agent and order for the subscription. 
  After the subscription, the agent will send the each copy to us. And if are wish to unscribe, they will stop sending the newspaper or magazine.
  Thus we dont need to go for each and every edition.
